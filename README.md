# Cats as a Service

This repo was built to use in a role-playing based incident training workshop. The idea was that I served as a "game master" like DnD, and would use this website in place of real infrastructure. The team will ask questions and navigate the website and attempt to get the websites diagnostics healthy and green, as well as fix the service to deploy cats on demand. As the game master, I would act as the medium between the team, and the website and various services that the website uses.

This repos HTML and scenario was based on an existing incident scenario repo built at HashiCorp but has been since modified.
